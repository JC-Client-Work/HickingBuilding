				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>We are a group of owners who have concerns regarding the management and administration of the Hicking Building. This website contains information on our actions so far, our planned actions, and how you can get involved. It also corrects disinformation that Stoneyard has been disseminating about our actions.</p>
				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>Responsibility for the management of the Hicking Building sits with a company called The Hicking Building RTM Company Ltd. There is a board of directors of the RTM company, which consists of flat owners within the Hicking Building who are responsible for making operational management decisions. These directors are volunteers, and Stoneyard Property Management are engaged to manage the day-to-day aspects of managing the building.</p>
				<p>We have serious concerns regarding the current board of directors not applying a reasonable level of scrutiny to Stoneyard's activities.</p>
				<p>Our attempts to raise these concerns directly with Stoneyard resulted in no meaningful outcome. Attempts to discuss matters directly with the appointed directors have also been fruitless. AGMs have not been held for years. Therefore, our only option was to apply to the Property Tribunal to have our concerns heard and independently adjudicated on.</p>

					<h2>Current situation</h2>
					<p>In summary, the Tribunal cases highlighted that <u>we are being charged excessive service charges</u> which is largely based on the advice received from Stoneyard. It is clear that the current directors are either incapable of applying any critical evaluation to the advice being received or are not applying the correct level of diligence.</p>
					<p>The one director who questioned the RTM Company's decisions was ignored and eventually removed from the board without his knowledge or agreement. The board have refused to allow any of us onto the board and have refused to have any meaningful discussion with us.</p>
					<p>After the Tribunal determination, the RTM Company has made no attempts to communicate with the owners. We thus have no official information about whether Stoneyard is still in charge of carrying out the fire safety works or whether efforts are being made to appoint a third party after evaluating competitive quotes.</p>
					<p>Stoneyard has circulated partial and misleading information on the Tribunal determinations.</p>
					<p>It cannot continue that Stoneyard are permitted to manipulate the directors of the RTM Company into making decisions that benefit Stoneyard.</p>

					<h1>Summary of our actions so far</h1>
					<p>We submitted two cases to the Property Tribunal in 2020. In each case, the Tribunal supported our concerns.</p>
					<h2>First Tribunal case</h2>
					<p>This was about the external cladding and balcony work that Stoneyard claimed was necessary to obtain an EWS1 certificate at the estimated cost of £115,000. Based on the quotations put forward by Stoneyard the majority of those costs were for the work to individual balconies.</p>
					<p>This concerned us as it was clear to us that the responsibility of each balcony sat with the individual property owner and therefore should not be a shared cost. Stoneyard claimed at the Tribunal that the balconies were part of the areas they maintained and should be included in the service charge. We were also concerned because the position taken by Stoneyard did not follow the professional advice on timber decked balconies.</p>
					<p><span class="empInlineText">The Tribunal agreed with us on both points.</span></p>
					<p>You can find the full Tribunal determination <a href="./documents/Determination 1.pdf" target="_blank">link to documents</a> (the Tribunal's determination starts on page 22, paragraph 95)</p>
				</section>
				<section id="history2">
					<h2>Second Tribunal case</h2>
					<p>This is about a project for internal fire protection work totalling <span class="empInlineText">around £500,000 which is to be paid directly to Stoneyard</span>. Stoneyard claimed that they were the only viable solution for this work to be completed because no other contractor would do the work. Despite the Stoneyard's obvious conflict, this was accepted by the RTM Company accepted their recommendation without challenge.</p>
					<p>Neither RTM company directors nor Stoneyard communicated to owners. We only found out about this accidentally.</p>
					<p><span class="empInlineText">The Tribunal agreed with us.</span> The Tribunal found that Stoneyard had overcharged for the work by around 20%. These are quotes from the Tribunal determination that effectively summarise the situation (note: Respondent refers to the RTM Company):</p>
					<p>85: "…some directors of the Respondent (on their own admission) failed to read that report sounds alarm bells. A director of a company (even a volunteer) has to understand the decisions he or she is taking."</p>
					<p>90: "Whatever the difficulties the board was facing in late 2019 regarding contracting for the Corridor Works, in our view they were not live to the disadvantages they were exposing themselves to by following their preferred route of contracting with Stoneyard… Stoneyard had a conflict of interest. We have seen no evidence of any attempts by the board to ensure those conflicts were appropriately managed. The failure to obtain competitive quotations was compounded by the further error of contracting with their own adviser without taking steps to manage the conflicts of interest this created."</p>
					<p>94: "In summary, the Tribunal's view is that a reasonable RTM company / landlord would not have contracted for the Corridor Works without testing the market thoroughly, if necessary by obtaining a professionally prepared specification of works. It would not have allowed itself to enter into an arrangement with an adviser which had a conflict of interest, even if that adviser was offering competitive terms, without proper independent advice, negotiation, and scrutiny of the terms, and it would have ensured that the terms of the arrangement were properly documented."</p>
					<p>We challenged the necessity of the cladding work only insofar as there was no evidence at all that the cladding was combustible. While a report from a third party specialist claims it to be combustible, the report lacked detail. The Tribunal took the report in good faith. However, they did comment that the evidence supporting the necessity for the work was "far from ideal", paragraph 97.</p>
					<p>You can find the full Tribunal determination <a href="./documents/Determination 2.pdf" target="_blank">link to documents</a> (the Tribunal's determination starts on page 18, paragraph 82)</p>
					<h2>Application for dispensation from legal fees</h2>
					<p>The RTM Company decided to appoint legal representation for the first two Tribunal cases. We learned from a letter sent by Stoneyard in November 2020 this this amounts to 70k and that owners could be required to pay this through their service charges We found this unreasonable since we had repeatedly tried to engage the RTM Company in addressing to our concerns, but they systematically neglected to do so. Additionally, this means penalising owners for exercising their right to scrutinise the actions of the RTM Company who should represent their interests.</p>
					<p>We therefore applied for dispensation from paying these legal fees.</p>
					<p><span class="empInlineText">The Tribunal agreed with us.</span> The following are quotes from the Tribunal determination: (Note: Applicants refers to the owners who applied for dispensation)</p>
					<p>26: "<b>We do not think it would be just and equitable for the Applicants to make any contribution</b> towards the First Respondents costs of this case."</p>
					<p>27: "what the proceedings exposed was <b>a significant failure on the part of the First Respondent's board and/or its managing agent to discharge their responsibilities in the best interests of the service charge payers.</b> We refer to paragraphs 82 to 94 of the September Decision in which our criticisms are identified. We do not think these deficiencies would have come to light without the proceedings"</p>
